# Do you have strange, unexplained lag emanating from NametagEdit? Likely it's a few plugins
# manipulating the primary scoreboard, and not clearing the resources. This setting will
# clear empty teams on a timer. You can also clear it with /nte teams clear. This setting
# will be in seconds. e.g. every 300 seconds clear empty teams (5 minutes). Set this to < 1
# to disable this feature.
ClearEmptyTeamsInterval: -1
#
# If enabled, NametagEdit will turn your console into spam
# heaven. Useful for reporting issues!
Debug: false
#
# Some servers have different permissions per world, and therefore different potential nametags
# per world. If you want to refresh a player's nametag when they change worlds, set
# this option to true.
RefreshTagOnWorldChange: false
#
# If enabled, NametagEdit will refresh nametags on an interval. Note: this does NOT do any
# reloading. This will not pickup changes made from the file or database. Instead, it will
# take any changes made by commands and/or placeholder changes. Set this to < 1 to disable
# this feature. This feature is in seconds. NOTE: We do not recommend this.
RefreshInterval: 0

#Disables the command
